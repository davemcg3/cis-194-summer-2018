-- 1) Make a list lists starting from n to the length of the list
-- incremented by 2*n where n is a number from 1 to the length of the list. 
--   eg, length 5 = [[1,2,3,4,5], [2, 4], [3], [4], [5]]
-- 2) map those numbers to the input string as indexes.

-- 1) recursively pattern match on the input with (x:y:[]) 
--    as the base case returning the accumulator list ys.
-- 2) if y is a local maxima then concat is onto the accumulator
--    and recurse on the tail.
